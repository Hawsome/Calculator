HTML CODE:

This code is an HTML code for a simple calculator web page. Let's go through each section:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is a document type declaration that specifies the version of HTML being used in the web page. In this case, it is HTML5.

- `<html>`: This tag indicates the start of an HTML document.

- `<head>`: This is the section of the HTML document that contains metadata about the web page such as the character encoding, viewport settings, description, author, and so on.

- `<meta charset="utf-8">`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding used in the web page. utf-8 is the most commonly used character encoding for web pages.

- `<meta name="viewport" content="width-device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This meta tag specifies the viewport settings for the web page. In this case, it sets the width of the viewport to the device width and sets the initial zoom level to 1.0.

- `<meta lang="en-us">`: This meta tag specifies the language of the web page. In this case, it is set to US English.

- `<meta property="og:type" content="website">`: This meta tag specifies the Open Graph type of the web page. Open Graph is a protocol used to provide metadata for social media platforms.

- `<meta name="description" content="A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations">`: This meta tag provides a brief description of the web page that can be used by search engines.

- `<meta name="author" content="Olaoluwa Akinfenwa">`: This meta tag specifies the author of the web page.

- `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`: This meta tag specifies the search engine robots to index and follow the web page.

- `<title>Calculator</title>`: This tag specifies the title of the web page that is displayed in the browser tab.

- `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">`: This tag links to an external CSS file that is used to style the web page.

- `<body>`: This is the section of the HTML document that contains the visible content of the web page.

- `<div class="calculator">`: This is a container element that holds all the elements of the calculator.

- `<input type="text" class="display" readonly>`: This tag creates an input element that displays the numbers and operators entered by the user and the result of calculations. The `readonly` attribute prevents users from typing into the input field.

- `<button>`: These tags create clickable buttons that represent the numbers, operators, and clear button of the calculator. Each button has a unique class name and an `onclick` attribute that calls a JavaScript function when the button is clicked.

- `<script src="script.js"></script>`: This tag links to an external JavaScript file that contains the functions that perform the calculations and update the display.

CSS CODE:

This code contains a series of CSS rules that styles various elements of a calculator interface and includes animations. Here's an explanation of the different sections and their purpose:

Global Styles:
body: Sets the font family, size, and color for the entire document.
body: Sets a background color for the document.

Header Styles:
header: Styles the header element of the calculator.
header h1: Styles the header title within the header element.

Calculator Container Styles:
.calculator: Styles the container element for the calculator.
Calculator Display Styles:
.display: Styles the display element of the calculator.

Calculator Button Styles:
button: Styles the buttons within the calculator.
button:hover: Styles the buttons when hovered over.
button.operator: Styles the operator buttons differently.
button.clear: Styles the clear button differently.
button.equal: Styles the equal button differently.
button.delete: Styles the delete button differently.
button.delete:hover: Styles the delete button when hovered over.

Footer Styles:
footer: Styles the footer element of the calculator.

Social Icons Styles:
.social-icons: Styles the container for social icons.
.social-icons a: Styles the social icon links within the container.
.social-icons i: Styles the social icon elements within the links.
.social-icons a:hover i: Styles the social icons when hovered over.

Media Queries:
@media: Defines styles for different screen sizes.
@media only screen and (max-width: 360px): Styles for screens smaller than 360px.
@media only screen and (min-width: 361px) and (max-width: 1024px): Styles for screens between 361px and 1024px.

JAVASCRIPT CODE:

This is a JavaScript code that defines a simple calculator. Here's an explanation of each part:

Variable Declarations:

let display = document.querySelector(".display");: This line selects an element with the class "display" from the HTML document and assigns it to the display variable.
let operator = "";: This variable will store the current operator (+, -, *, /) for the calculator.
let firstNumber = "";: This variable will store the first number entered for the calculation.
let secondNumber = "";: This variable will store the second number entered for the calculation.
addToDisplay(num) function:

This function is called when a number or decimal point is pressed. It appends the provided num to the display value.
If the current display value is "0," it replaces it with num instead of appending it.
clearDisplay() function:

This function is called when the calculator needs to be cleared.
It resets the display value to "0" and clears the operator, firstNumber, and secondNumber variables.
setOperator(op) function:

This function is called when an operator (+, -, *, /) is pressed.
It stores the provided operator op, saves the current display value as the firstNumber, and resets the display value to "0" for the next input.
calculate() function:

This function is called when the "=" or "Enter" key is pressed or when the equal button is clicked.
It performs the calculation based on the stored operator and the firstNumber and secondNumber values.
The result is computed and assigned to the result variable using parseFloat to handle decimal values.
The display value is updated with the calculated result, and the operator and number variables are reset.
deleteLastCharacter() function:

This function is called when the backspace or delete key is pressed.
It removes the last character from the display value by using the slice method.
handleKeyboardInput(event) function:

This function is called when a key is pressed on the keyboard.
It handles the input based on the pressed key:
If the key is a digit (0-9), it calls addToDisplay with the corresponding digit.
If the key is a period (.), it appends a decimal point to the display value.
If the key is "=" or "Enter," it calls the calculate function.
If the key is an operator (+, -, *, /), it calls the setOperator function.
document.addEventListener("keydown", function(event) { ... });:

This code attaches an event listener to the keydown event of the document.
When a key is pressed, it triggers the anonymous function provided, which handles the keyboard input based on the event code.
The event codes are matched to the corresponding digits, operators, and special keys to perform the appropriate actions.
The code combines the use of DOM manipulation (document.querySelector), event handling, and conditional statements to create a functional calculator that responds to both button clicks and keyboard input.
