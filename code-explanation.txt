HTML CODE:

This code is an HTML code for a simple calculator web page. Let's go through each section:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is a document type declaration that specifies the version of HTML being used in the web page. In this case, it is HTML5.

- `<html>`: This tag indicates the start of an HTML document.

- `<head>`: This is the section of the HTML document that contains metadata about the web page such as the character encoding, viewport settings, description, author, and so on.

- `<meta charset="utf-8">`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding used in the web page. utf-8 is the most commonly used character encoding for web pages.

- `<meta name="viewport" content="width-device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This meta tag specifies the viewport settings for the web page. In this case, it sets the width of the viewport to the device width and sets the initial zoom level to 1.0.

- `<meta lang="en-us">`: This meta tag specifies the language of the web page. In this case, it is set to US English.

- `<meta property="og:type" content="website">`: This meta tag specifies the Open Graph type of the web page. Open Graph is a protocol used to provide metadata for social media platforms.

- `<meta name="description" content="A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations">`: This meta tag provides a brief description of the web page that can be used by search engines.

- `<meta name="author" content="Olaoluwa Akinfenwa">`: This meta tag specifies the author of the web page.

- `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`: This meta tag specifies the search engine robots to index and follow the web page.

- `<title>Calculator</title>`: This tag specifies the title of the web page that is displayed in the browser tab.

- `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">`: This tag links to an external CSS file that is used to style the web page.

- `<body>`: This is the section of the HTML document that contains the visible content of the web page.

- `<div class="calculator">`: This is a container element that holds all the elements of the calculator.

- `<input type="text" class="display" readonly>`: This tag creates an input element that displays the numbers and operators entered by the user and the result of calculations. The `readonly` attribute prevents users from typing into the input field.

- `<button>`: These tags create clickable buttons that represent the numbers, operators, and clear button of the calculator. Each button has a unique class name and an `onclick` attribute that calls a JavaScript function when the button is clicked.

- `<script src="script.js"></script>`: This tag links to an external JavaScript file that contains the functions that perform the calculations and update the display.

CSS CODE:

This code contains a series of CSS rules that styles various elements of a calculator interface and includes animations. Here's an explanation of the different sections and their purpose:

Global Styles:
body: Sets the font family, size, and color for the entire document.
body: Sets a background color for the document.

Header Styles:
header: Styles the header element of the calculator.
header h1: Styles the header title within the header element.

Calculator Container Styles:
.calculator: Styles the container element for the calculator.
Calculator Display Styles:
.display: Styles the display element of the calculator.

Calculator Button Styles:
button: Styles the buttons within the calculator.
button:hover: Styles the buttons when hovered over.
button.operator: Styles the operator buttons differently.
button.clear: Styles the clear button differently.
button.equal: Styles the equal button differently.
button.delete: Styles the delete button differently.
button.delete:hover: Styles the delete button when hovered over.

Footer Styles:
footer: Styles the footer element of the calculator.

Social Icons Styles:
.social-icons: Styles the container for social icons.
.social-icons a: Styles the social icon links within the container.
.social-icons i: Styles the social icon elements within the links.
.social-icons a:hover i: Styles the social icons when hovered over.

Media Queries:
@media: Defines styles for different screen sizes.
@media only screen and (max-width: 360px): Styles for screens smaller than 360px.
@media only screen and (min-width: 361px) and (max-width: 1024px): Styles for screens between 361px and 1024px.

JAVASCRIPT CODE:

This is a JavaScript code that defines a simple calculator. Here's an explanation of each part:

let display = document.querySelector(".display");

This line selects an HTML element with the class name "display" using the document.querySelector() method and assigns it to the display variable. This element represents the display area of the calculator where numbers and results are shown.
let operator = ""; let firstNumber = ""; let secondNumber = "";

These lines declare three variables: operator, firstNumber, and secondNumber. These variables will be used to store the operator, the first number entered by the user, and the second number entered by the user, respectively. They are initialized as empty strings.
function addToDisplay(num) { ... }

This is a function called addToDisplay that takes a parameter num. It adds the specified num to the display area by updating the value property of the display element. If the current value in the display is "0", it replaces it; otherwise, it appends the new value to the existing one.
function clearDisplay() { ... }

This is a function called clearDisplay. It sets the value property of the display element to "0" and resets the operator, firstNumber, and secondNumber variables to empty values.
function setOperator(op) { ... }

This is a function called setOperator that takes a parameter op. It sets the operator variable to the specified op, stores the current value in the display as the firstNumber, and resets the value property of the display element to "0".
function calculate() { ... }

This is a function called calculate. It performs the calculation based on the stored operator, firstNumber, and the current value in the display (secondNumber). It converts the numbers to floats using parseFloat() and applies the corresponding operation based on the operator. The result is then assigned to the result variable and displayed in the value property of the display element. Finally, the operator, firstNumber, and secondNumber are reset to empty values.
function deleteLastCharacter() { ... }

This is a function called deleteLastCharacter. It removes the last character from the value property of the display element by using the slice() method.
function handleKeyboardInput(event) { ... }

This is a function called handleKeyboardInput that takes an event parameter. It handles the keyboard input by mapping different keys to their corresponding actions. If a digit key (0-9) is pressed, it calls the addToDisplay() function with the respective digit. If the dot (.) key is pressed, it adds a decimal point to the display. If the equal (=) or enter key is pressed, it calls the calculate() function. If an operator key (+, -, *, /) is pressed, it calls the setOperator() function with the respective operator.
document.addEventListener("keydown", function(event) { ... });

This code attaches a keydown event listener to the document object. It listens for keyboard input and calls the handleKeyboardInput() function based on the key code. It maps specific keys to their corresponding actions, such as adding digits, performing calculations, setting operators, etc.
Overall, the code sets up the necessary functions and event listeners to create a basic calculator that allows the user to perform calculations using both button clicks and keyboard
