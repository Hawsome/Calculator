- `<button>`: These tags create clickable buttons that represent the numbers, operators, and clear button of the calculator. Each button has a unique class name and an `onclick` attribute that calls a JavaScript function when the button is clicked.

- `<script src="script.js"></script>`: This tag links to an external JavaScript file that contains the functions that perform the calculations and update the display.

CSS CODE:

This code contains a series of CSS rules that styles various elements of a calculator interface and includes animations. Here's an explanation of the different sections and their purpose:

The provided CSS code contains styling rules for various elements in the calculator application. Let's go through each section and explain what it does:

1. Font and General Styling:
   - The `body` selector sets the font family to "Roboto", Arial, sans-serif, the font size to 16 pixels, and the text color to #333 (dark gray).
   - The `body` selector also sets a background gradient using the `linear-gradient` function, creating a modern background effect.

2. Header Styling:
   - The `header` selector styles the header element, setting the background color to #172a45 (dark blue), the text color to #fff (white), adding padding, center-aligning the text, and applying a border-radius and box shadow to give it a rounded and shadowed appearance.
   - The `header h1` selector styles the heading within the header, setting the font size to 36 pixels and removing any margin.

3. Calculator Container Styling:
   - The `.calculator` selector styles the calculator container element, using CSS grid to create a grid layout with four equal columns, setting a maximum width, margin, padding, border, background color, border-radius, and box shadow.

4. Calculator Display Styling:
   - The `.display` selector styles the calculator display input element, spanning across all columns, setting a height, font size, right-aligned text, padding, border, border-radius, background color, and box shadow.

5. Calculator Button Styling:
   - The `button` selector styles all buttons within the calculator, setting their width, height, font size, removing the border, adding border-radius, background color, text color, cursor style, and transition effect.
   - The `button:hover` selector styles the buttons when hovered, changing the background color and applying a scale transform to create a slight zoom effect.

6. Operator, Clear, and Equal Button Styling:
   - The `.operator` selector styles operator buttons, setting a different background color, text color, and font weight.
   - The `.clear` selector styles the clear button, setting a different background color, text color, and font weight.
   - The `.equal` selector styles the equal button, setting a different background color, text color, and font weight.

7. Delete Button Styling:
   - The `.delete` selector styles the delete button, setting a different background color, text color, and font weight.
   - The `.delete:hover` selector styles the delete button when hovered, changing the background color.

8. Footer Styling:
   - The `footer` selector styles the footer element, setting the background color to #172a45 (dark blue), the text color to #fff (white), adding padding, center-aligning the text, applying a border-radius and box shadow to give it a rounded and shadowed appearance.

9. Footer Text Styling:
   - The `footer p` selector styles the text within the footer, removing any margin and setting the font size to 14 pixels.

10. Animation Keyframes:
   - The `@keyframes` rule defines two animations: `fadeIn` and `slideIn`. These animations are used to create fading and sliding effects when elements are displayed.

11. Social Icons Styling:
   - The `.social-icons` selector styles the social icons container, adding top margin and center-aligning the icons.
   - The `.social-icons a` selector styles the social icons, displaying them as inline-block elements, adding right margin, setting the color to #fff (white), and defining a transition effect for the color change.
   - The `.social-icons a.linkedin:hover`, `.social-icons a.twitter:hover`, and `.social-icons a.email:hover` selectors style the respective

JAVASCRIPT CODE:

This is a JavaScript code that defines a simple calculator. Here's an explanation of each part:

Sure! Here's an explanation of each line of code in this snippet:

Sure! Here's an explanation of the code you provided:

1. `let display = document.querySelector('.display');`: This line selects the element with the class "display" using `document.querySelector()`. It assigns the selected element to the `display` variable, which will be used to update the display value.

2. `let operator = '';`: This variable `operator` is used to store the current operator (+, -, *, or /) selected by the user.

3. `let firstNumber = '';`: This variable `firstNumber` is used to store the first operand of the calculation.

4. `let result = null;`: This variable `result` is used to store the result of the calculation.

5. `function addToDisplay(num) { ... }`: This function is called when a number button is clicked. It adds the clicked number to the display value. If the current display value is '0' or an operator is already selected, it replaces the display value with the clicked number. Otherwise, it appends the number to the existing display value.

6. `function clearDisplay() { ... }`: This function is called when the clear button is clicked. It resets the display value to '0', clears the `operator`, `firstNumber`, and `result` variables.

7. `function setOperator(op) { ... }`: This function is called when an operator button (+, -, *, /) is clicked. If an operator is already selected, it calls the `calculate()` function to perform the previous calculation. It then assigns the clicked operator to the `operator` variable, stores the current display value in `firstNumber`, and resets the display value to '0'.

8. `function calculate() { ... }`: This function is called when the equal (=) button is clicked. It performs the calculation based on the selected operator and updates the `result` variable. If `result` is `null`, it assigns the result of the current calculation to `result`. Otherwise, it calls the `performOperation()` function to perform the operation using the previous result, the current operator, and the second number. It then updates the display value with the `result`, clears the `operator` and `firstNumber` variables, and prepares for the next calculation.

9. `function performOperation(num1, op, num2) { ... }`: This function performs the arithmetic operation based on the provided operator. It takes two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) and the operator (`op`) as arguments and returns the result of the operation.

10. `function deleteLastCharacter() { ... }`: This function is called when the delete button is clicked. It removes the last character from the display value by using the `slice()` method.

These functions work together to handle user interactions, update the display, and perform calculations based on the selected operator.
