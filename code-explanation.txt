HTML CODE:

This code is an HTML code for a simple calculator web page. Let's go through each section:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is a document type declaration that specifies the version of HTML being used in the web page. In this case, it is HTML5.

- `<html>`: This tag indicates the start of an HTML document.

- `<head>`: This is the section of the HTML document that contains metadata about the web page such as the character encoding, viewport settings, description, author, and so on.

- `<meta charset="utf-8">`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding used in the web page. utf-8 is the most commonly used character encoding for web pages.

- `<meta name="viewport" content="width-device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This meta tag specifies the viewport settings for the web page. In this case, it sets the width of the viewport to the device width and sets the initial zoom level to 1.0.

- `<meta lang="en-us">`: This meta tag specifies the language of the web page. In this case, it is set to US English.

- `<meta property="og:type" content="website">`: This meta tag specifies the Open Graph type of the web page. Open Graph is a protocol used to provide metadata for social media platforms.

- `<meta name="description" content="A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations">`: This meta tag provides a brief description of the web page that can be used by search engines.

- `<meta name="author" content="Olaoluwa Akinfenwa">`: This meta tag specifies the author of the web page.

- `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`: This meta tag specifies the search engine robots to index and follow the web page.

- `<title>Calculator</title>`: This tag specifies the title of the web page that is displayed in the browser tab.

- `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">`: This tag links to an external CSS file that is used to style the web page.

- `<body>`: This is the section of the HTML document that contains the visible content of the web page.

- `<div class="calculator">`: This is a container element that holds all the elements of the calculator.

- `<input type="text" class="display" readonly>`: This tag creates an input element that displays the numbers and operators entered by the user and the result of calculations. The `readonly` attribute prevents users from typing into the input field.

- `<button>`: These tags create clickable buttons that represent the numbers, operators, and clear button of the calculator. Each button has a unique class name and an `onclick` attribute that calls a JavaScript function when the button is clicked.

- `<script src="script.js"></script>`: This tag links to an external JavaScript file that contains the functions that perform the calculations and update the display.

CSS CODE:

This code contains a series of CSS rules that styles various elements of a calculator interface and includes animations. Here's an explanation of the different sections and their purpose:

Font, size, and color:

Sets the font family to Arial, sans-serif.
Sets the font size to 16 pixels.
Sets the text color to black (#000).
Background color:

Sets the background color of the body element to a light gray (#f5f5f5).
Header styling:

Sets the background color of the header element to a specific orange shade (#f7a23e).
Sets the text color to white.
Adds padding, text alignment, border radius, and box shadow to the header element.
Applies a fade-in animation to the header element using keyframes.
Header title styling:

Sets the font size to 36 pixels.
Removes the top margin from the header title.
Calculator container styling:

Sets the display property to flex and enables wrapping.
Sets a fixed width of 300 pixels.
Applies margins and border radius to the calculator container.
Adds a box shadow to create a subtle shadow effect.
Calculator display styling:

Sets the width and height of the display element.
Sets the font size and alignment.
Adds padding, border, border radius, background color, and box shadow to the display element.
Applies a slide-in animation to the display element using keyframes.
Calculator button styling:

Sets the width, height, margins, font size, border, border radius, and background color for the buttons.
Defines a transition effect for smooth hover state transitions.
Operator button styling:

Sets a specific background color and text color for the operator buttons.
Clear button styling:

Sets a specific background color and text color for the clear button.
Equal button styling:

Sets a specific background color and text color for the equal button.
Footer styling:

Sets the background color, text color, padding, text alignment, border radius, and box shadow for the footer.
Social icons styling:

Sets margins and default color for the social icons.
Social icons hover styling:

Sets the color of the icons to a specific shade when hovered.
Adds a bounce animation effect to the icons using keyframes.
Media queries:

Adjusts the calculator container width, margin-top, and button width/font size for screens smaller than 360 pixels and between 361 pixels and 1024 pixels.
Modifies the footer margin-top for different screen sizes.

JAVASCRIPT CODE:

This is a JavaScript code that defines a simple calculator. The code starts by declaring three variables `display`, `operator`, `firstNumber`, and `secondNumber`. The `display` variable stores the calculator's display element, while the `operator`, `firstNumber`, and `secondNumber` variables store the current operator, the first number entered by the user, and the second number entered by the user, respectively.

The code then defines four functions:

1. `addToDisplay(num)` - This function is called when a user clicks on a number button. It adds the number to the display element. If the display value is `0`, the number replaces `0`. Otherwise, the number is added to the end of the display value.

2. `clearDisplay()` - This function is called when the user clicks on the clear button. It resets the display value, operator, firstNumber, and secondNumber to their default values.

3. `setOperator(op)` - This function is called when a user clicks on an operator button (+, -, *, /). It sets the operator variable to the clicked operator, sets the firstNumber variable to the current display value, and resets the display value to 0.

4. `calculate()` - This function is called when a user clicks on the equal button. It gets the secondNumber variable value from the display and performs the appropriate calculation based on the operator value. It then updates the display value to the result and resets the operator, firstNumber, and secondNumber variables.

In summary, the JavaScript code defines a simple calculator with four functions that handle input and calculation.
