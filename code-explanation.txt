HTML CODE:

This code is an HTML code for a simple calculator web page. Let's go through each section:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is a document type declaration that specifies the version of HTML being used in the web page. In this case, it is HTML5.

- `<html>`: This tag indicates the start of an HTML document.

- `<head>`: This is the section of the HTML document that contains metadata about the web page such as the character encoding, viewport settings, description, author, and so on.

- `<meta charset="utf-8">`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding used in the web page. utf-8 is the most commonly used character encoding for web pages.

- `<meta name="viewport" content="width-device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This meta tag specifies the viewport settings for the web page. In this case, it sets the width of the viewport to the device width and sets the initial zoom level to 1.0.

- `<meta lang="en-us">`: This meta tag specifies the language of the web page. In this case, it is set to US English.

- `<meta property="og:type" content="website">`: This meta tag specifies the Open Graph type of the web page. Open Graph is a protocol used to provide metadata for social media platforms.

- `<meta name="description" content="A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations">`: This meta tag provides a brief description of the web page that can be used by search engines.

- `<meta name="author" content="Olaoluwa Akinfenwa">`: This meta tag specifies the author of the web page.

- `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`: This meta tag specifies the search engine robots to index and follow the web page.

- `<title>Calculator</title>`: This tag specifies the title of the web page that is displayed in the browser tab.

- `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">`: This tag links to an external CSS file that is used to style the web page.

- `<body>`: This is the section of the HTML document that contains the visible content of the web page.

- `<div class="calculator">`: This is a container element that holds all the elements of the calculator.

- `<input type="text" class="display" readonly>`: This tag creates an input element that displays the numbers and operators entered by the user and the result of calculations. The `readonly` attribute prevents users from typing into the input field.

- `<button>`: These tags create clickable buttons that represent the numbers, operators, and clear button of the calculator. Each button has a unique class name and an `onclick` attribute that calls a JavaScript function when the button is clicked.

- `<script src="script.js"></script>`: This tag links to an external JavaScript file that contains the functions that perform the calculations and update the display.

CSS CODE:

This code contains a series of CSS rules that styles various elements of a calculator interface and includes animations. Here's an explanation of the different sections and their purpose:

The provided CSS code contains styling rules for various elements in the calculator application. Let's go through each section and explain what it does:

1. Font and General Styling:
   - The `body` selector sets the font family to "Roboto", Arial, sans-serif, the font size to 16 pixels, and the text color to #333 (dark gray).
   - The `body` selector also sets a background gradient using the `linear-gradient` function, creating a modern background effect.

2. Header Styling:
   - The `header` selector styles the header element, setting the background color to #172a45 (dark blue), the text color to #fff (white), adding padding, center-aligning the text, and applying a border-radius and box shadow to give it a rounded and shadowed appearance.
   - The `header h1` selector styles the heading within the header, setting the font size to 36 pixels and removing any margin.

3. Calculator Container Styling:
   - The `.calculator` selector styles the calculator container element, using CSS grid to create a grid layout with four equal columns, setting a maximum width, margin, padding, border, background color, border-radius, and box shadow.

4. Calculator Display Styling:
   - The `.display` selector styles the calculator display input element, spanning across all columns, setting a height, font size, right-aligned text, padding, border, border-radius, background color, and box shadow.

5. Calculator Button Styling:
   - The `button` selector styles all buttons within the calculator, setting their width, height, font size, removing the border, adding border-radius, background color, text color, cursor style, and transition effect.
   - The `button:hover` selector styles the buttons when hovered, changing the background color and applying a scale transform to create a slight zoom effect.

6. Operator, Clear, and Equal Button Styling:
   - The `.operator` selector styles operator buttons, setting a different background color, text color, and font weight.
   - The `.clear` selector styles the clear button, setting a different background color, text color, and font weight.
   - The `.equal` selector styles the equal button, setting a different background color, text color, and font weight.

7. Delete Button Styling:
   - The `.delete` selector styles the delete button, setting a different background color, text color, and font weight.
   - The `.delete:hover` selector styles the delete button when hovered, changing the background color.

8. Footer Styling:
   - The `footer` selector styles the footer element, setting the background color to #172a45 (dark blue), the text color to #fff (white), adding padding, center-aligning the text, applying a border-radius and box shadow to give it a rounded and shadowed appearance.

9. Footer Text Styling:
   - The `footer p` selector styles the text within the footer, removing any margin and setting the font size to 14 pixels.

10. Animation Keyframes:
   - The `@keyframes` rule defines two animations: `fadeIn` and `slideIn`. These animations are used to create fading and sliding effects when elements are displayed.

11. Social Icons Styling:
   - The `.social-icons` selector styles the social icons container, adding top margin and center-aligning the icons.
   - The `.social-icons a` selector styles the social icons, displaying them as inline-block elements, adding right margin, setting the color to #fff (white), and defining a transition effect for the color change.
   - The `.social-icons a.linkedin:hover`, `.social-icons a.twitter:hover`, and `.social-icons a.email:hover` selectors style the respective

JAVASCRIPT CODE:

This is a JavaScript code that defines a simple calculator. Here's an explanation of each part:

Sure! Here's an explanation of each line of code in this snippet:

```
let display = document.querySelector(".display");
```

This line of code creates a variable called `display` and assigns it the result of the `document.querySelector()` method. This method looks for the first element in the HTML document that has a class of `display`. This element is usually an input field or a div where we will display the numbers entered by the user.

```
let operator = "";
let firstNumber = "";
let secondNumber = "";
```

These three lines create three more variables: `operator`, `firstNumber`, and `secondNumber`. They are initially empty strings, and they will be used to store the values entered by the user.

```
function addToDisplay(num) {
	if (display.value === "0") {
		display.value = num;
	} else {
		display.value += num;
	}
}
```

This function adds a number to the display when the user clicks on a number button. If the current value of the display is "0", it replaces it with the clicked number. Otherwise, it appends the clicked number to the current value of the display.

```
function clearDisplay() {
	display.value = "0";
	operator = "";
	firstNumber = "";
	secondNumber = "";
}
```

This function clears the display and resets the values of the operator and the two numbers to their default values.

```
function setOperator(op) {
	operator = op;
	firstNumber = display.value;
	display.value = "0";
}
```

This function sets the operator to the value of the clicked operator button, stores the value displayed in the `display` variable in the `firstNumber` variable, and then sets the `display` variable to "0".

```
function calculate() {
	secondNumber = display.value;
	let result = 0;

	if (operator === "+") {
		result = parseFloat(firstNumber) + parseFloat(secondNumber);
	} else if (operator === "-") {
		result = parseFloat(firstNumber) - parseFloat(secondNumber);
	} else if (operator === "*") {
		result = parseFloat(firstNumber) * parseFloat(secondNumber);
	} else if (operator === "/") {
		result = parseFloat(firstNumber) / parseFloat(secondNumber);
	}

	display.value = result;
	operator = "";
	firstNumber = "";
	secondNumber = "";
}
```

This function calculates the result of the mathematical operation entered by the user. It stores the value displayed in the `display` variable in the `secondNumber` variable, and then checks the value of the `operator` variable to determine which mathematical operation to perform. The result of the operation is stored in the `result` variable. Finally, the `display` variable is set to the value of the `result` variable, and all the variables are reset to their default values.

```
function deleteLastCharacter() {
	display.value = display.value.slice(0, -1);
}
```

This function removes the last character from the `display` variable, effectively undoing the last button click. It uses the `slice()` method to remove the last character from the string.
