HTML CODE:

This code is an HTML code for a simple calculator web page. Let's go through each section:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is a document type declaration that specifies the version of HTML being used in the web page. In this case, it is HTML5.

- `<html>`: This tag indicates the start of an HTML document.

- `<head>`: This is the section of the HTML document that contains metadata about the web page such as the character encoding, viewport settings, description, author, and so on.

- `<meta charset="utf-8">`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding used in the web page. utf-8 is the most commonly used character encoding for web pages.

- `<meta name="viewport" content="width-device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This meta tag specifies the viewport settings for the web page. In this case, it sets the width of the viewport to the device width and sets the initial zoom level to 1.0.

- `<meta lang="en-us">`: This meta tag specifies the language of the web page. In this case, it is set to US English.

- `<meta property="og:type" content="website">`: This meta tag specifies the Open Graph type of the web page. Open Graph is a protocol used to provide metadata for social media platforms.

- `<meta name="description" content="A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations">`: This meta tag provides a brief description of the web page that can be used by search engines.

- `<meta name="author" content="Olaoluwa Akinfenwa">`: This meta tag specifies the author of the web page.

- `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`: This meta tag specifies the search engine robots to index and follow the web page.

- `<title>Calculator</title>`: This tag specifies the title of the web page that is displayed in the browser tab.

- `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">`: This tag links to an external CSS file that is used to style the web page.

- `<body>`: This is the section of the HTML document that contains the visible content of the web page.

- `<div class="calculator">`: This is a container element that holds all the elements of the calculator.

- `<input type="text" class="display" readonly>`: This tag creates an input element that displays the numbers and operators entered by the user and the result of calculations. The `readonly` attribute prevents users from typing into the input field.

- `<button>`: These tags create clickable buttons that represent the numbers, operators, and clear button of the calculator. Each button has a unique class name and an `onclick` attribute that calls a JavaScript function when the button is clicked.

- `<script src="script.js"></script>`: This tag links to an external JavaScript file that contains the functions that perform the calculations and update the display.

CSS CODE:

This code contains a series of CSS rules that styles various elements of a calculator interface and includes animations. Here's an explanation of the different sections and their purpose:

Global Styles:
body: Sets the font family, size, and color for the entire document.
body: Sets a background color for the document.

Header Styles:
header: Styles the header element of the calculator.
header h1: Styles the header title within the header element.

Calculator Container Styles:
.calculator: Styles the container element for the calculator.
Calculator Display Styles:
.display: Styles the display element of the calculator.

Calculator Button Styles:
button: Styles the buttons within the calculator.
button:hover: Styles the buttons when hovered over.
button.operator: Styles the operator buttons differently.
button.clear: Styles the clear button differently.
button.equal: Styles the equal button differently.
button.delete: Styles the delete button differently.
button.delete:hover: Styles the delete button when hovered over.

Footer Styles:
footer: Styles the footer element of the calculator.

Social Icons Styles:
.social-icons: Styles the container for social icons.
.social-icons a: Styles the social icon links within the container.
.social-icons i: Styles the social icon elements within the links.
.social-icons a:hover i: Styles the social icons when hovered over.

Media Queries:
@media: Defines styles for different screen sizes.
@media only screen and (max-width: 360px): Styles for screens smaller than 360px.
@media only screen and (min-width: 361px) and (max-width: 1024px): Styles for screens between 361px and 1024px.

JAVASCRIPT CODE:

This is a JavaScript code that defines a simple calculator. Here's an explanation of each part:

Sure! Here's an explanation of each line of code in this snippet:

```
let display = document.querySelector(".display");
```

This line of code creates a variable called `display` and assigns it the result of the `document.querySelector()` method. This method looks for the first element in the HTML document that has a class of `display`. This element is usually an input field or a div where we will display the numbers entered by the user.

```
let operator = "";
let firstNumber = "";
let secondNumber = "";
```

These three lines create three more variables: `operator`, `firstNumber`, and `secondNumber`. They are initially empty strings, and they will be used to store the values entered by the user.

```
function addToDisplay(num) {
	if (display.value === "0") {
		display.value = num;
	} else {
		display.value += num;
	}
}
```

This function adds a number to the display when the user clicks on a number button. If the current value of the display is "0", it replaces it with the clicked number. Otherwise, it appends the clicked number to the current value of the display.

```
function clearDisplay() {
	display.value = "0";
	operator = "";
	firstNumber = "";
	secondNumber = "";
}
```

This function clears the display and resets the values of the operator and the two numbers to their default values.

```
function setOperator(op) {
	operator = op;
	firstNumber = display.value;
	display.value = "0";
}
```

This function sets the operator to the value of the clicked operator button, stores the value displayed in the `display` variable in the `firstNumber` variable, and then sets the `display` variable to "0".

```
function calculate() {
	secondNumber = display.value;
	let result = 0;

	if (operator === "+") {
		result = parseFloat(firstNumber) + parseFloat(secondNumber);
	} else if (operator === "-") {
		result = parseFloat(firstNumber) - parseFloat(secondNumber);
	} else if (operator === "*") {
		result = parseFloat(firstNumber) * parseFloat(secondNumber);
	} else if (operator === "/") {
		result = parseFloat(firstNumber) / parseFloat(secondNumber);
	}

	display.value = result;
	operator = "";
	firstNumber = "";
	secondNumber = "";
}
```

This function calculates the result of the mathematical operation entered by the user. It stores the value displayed in the `display` variable in the `secondNumber` variable, and then checks the value of the `operator` variable to determine which mathematical operation to perform. The result of the operation is stored in the `result` variable. Finally, the `display` variable is set to the value of the `result` variable, and all the variables are reset to their default values.

```
function deleteLastCharacter() {
	display.value = display.value.slice(0, -1);
}
```

This function removes the last character from the `display` variable, effectively undoing the last button click. It uses the `slice()` method to remove the last character from the string.
